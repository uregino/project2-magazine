                    The history of matcha dates back to the Tang dynasty (618–907) in China, when tea leaves were steamed and compressed into bricks for storage and trade. According to Lu Yu's The Classic of Tea (760–762), tea was prepared by roasting compressed tea over a fire, grinding it into powder using a wooden grinder called niǎn (碾), and then adding the powder to boiling water. This early form of powdered tea was sometimes mixed with ingredients such as green onions, ginger, and mandarin orange peels.

                <h3>A Shift Towards Whisked Tea</h3>
                <p>During the Song dynasty (960–1279), powdered tea gained prominence, with tea preparation evolving into a refined process involving whisking the tea powder with hot water in a bowl. Though the term "matcha" was not yet used, this method laid the foundation for its development. High-grade compressed tea, like the prized Dragon and Phoenix Lump Tea, was ground with a metal niǎn, sifted, and whisked in a bowl with hot water. Texts such as Record of Tea by Cai Xiang (1049–1053) and Treatise on Tea by Emperor Huizong (1107) describe these practices, highlighting the importance of fine sieving and the pursuit of an ideal tea texture. However, the labor-intensive production of compressed tea made it costly and largely inaccessible to common people.</p>

                <h3>The Decline of Powdered Tea in China</h3>
                <p>By the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the production of compressed tea declined, culminating in Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's ban in 1391. This shift led to the rise of steeped loose-leaf tea, and the powdered tea tradition faded in China. However, matcha found new life in Japan, where it evolved independently based on Japanese aesthetics and traditions.</p>

                <h3>The Influence of Zen Buddhism</h3>
                <p>Matcha became central to Zen Buddhist rituals and gained popularity among the upper class. By the 14th century, stone mills replaced wooden grinders, refining the texture of matcha. The 16th century saw the rise of the Japanese tea ceremony, influenced by tea masters such as Murata Jukō and Sen no Rikyū. They emphasized simplicity and introspection, giving birth to the wabi-sabi aesthetic that characterizes the tea ceremony today.</p>

                <p>While China abandoned powdered tea, Japan cultivated matcha into an art form, preserving and refining its techniques. Today, matcha remains a revered component of Japanese culture, enjoyed both traditionally and in modern culinary innovations.</p>
