                <h3>Color, Flavor, and Aroma</h3>
                <p>Matcha is characterized by its bright green color, which is due to the increased chloroplasts in the leaves as they absorb more light while grown in the shade. Its flavor is dominated by strong umami notes, primarily influenced by amino acids. The tea’s distinct aroma, known as ooikou (覆い香), resembles green laver and results from the presence of dimethyl sulfide.

                <h3>Umami-Rich Composition</h3>
                <p>Green tea, especially in its matcha form, has a more umami-forward taste compared to black tea. Matcha contains twice the amount of amino acids as sencha green tea, with compounds such as theanine, succinic acid, gallic acid, and theogallin contributing to its deep umami profile. Since matcha is derived from tencha leaves, which are grown in shade, the breakdown of theanine is minimized. This shading process increases caffeine and total free amino acid content while reducing catechin accumulation.</p>

                <h3>Polyphenols and Antioxidants</h3>
                <p>Matcha contains polyphenols, including high amounts of chlorogenic acid, which are known for their antioxidant properties. These compounds contribute to matcha’s potential health benefits, such as improved metabolism, reduced inflammation, and enhanced cognitive function.</p>

                <h3>Types of Powdered Japanese Green Tea</h3>
                <p>There are four main types of powdered Japanese green tea, each with distinct characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Matcha (抹茶): Tea grown in the shade, steamed, dried without rolling, and ground into a fine powder. It is mixed directly with hot water for consumption.</li>
                    <li>Hunmatsucha (粉末茶): Crushed tea leaves consumed using a teapot or tea strainer.</li>
                    <li>Konacha (粉茶): Powdered tea that is sieved during the finishing process and dissolved in hot water.</li>
                    <li>Instant Tea (インスタントティー): Water-soluble solid extracted from green tea, concentrated, dried, and made into powder for quick preparation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All these varieties originate from Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, the small-leaf Chinese tea plant, and offer varying flavors and preparation methods suited to different preferences.</p>
