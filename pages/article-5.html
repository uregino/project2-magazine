                <h3>Steaming and Drying</h3>
                <p>The leaves of tencha, the raw material for matcha, are first steamed at 100°C (212°F) for 10–15 seconds. This steaming process softens the tea leaves and inactivates the oxidizing enzymes, preventing fermentation and preserving the bright green color. It also suppresses the production of glycosides, which affect taste. After steaming, the leaves are dried to prepare them for further processing.</p>

                <h3>Grinding Process</h3>
                <p>Once dried, the tencha leaves are ground into a fine powder using a grinding mill. Traditional stone mills are often used for high-quality matcha, as they produce a finer and smoother texture. This process is slow, ensuring that the leaves do not overheat and lose their delicate flavor and aroma.</p>

                <h3>Final Drying Stage</h3>
                <p>The powdered matcha undergoes a final drying process in a tea processing machine. The temperature inside the machine is set to approximately 170–200°C (338–392°F), but the tea leaves themselves remain at around 70°C to maintain their quality. This controlled drying process ensures that the matcha retains its freshness and potency.</p>

                <h3>Matcha Production Regions</h3>
                <p>The majority of matcha is produced in Japan, where it holds a deep cultural significance, particularly in the tea ceremony (chanoyu). While China and Vietnam also produce matcha, these varieties are typically considered inferior to Japanese matcha and are often used in iced beverages rather than traditional tea preparation.</p>

                <p>Matcha's meticulous production process plays a crucial role in delivering its distinctive flavor, health benefits, and aesthetic appeal, making it a prized ingredient in both traditional and modern applications.</p>
